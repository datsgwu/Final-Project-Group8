# Object Detection in Satellite Imagery

This repository contains code that walks through the implementation of Retinanet and YOLO in conducting object detection of small vehicles in satellite imagery. The code and steps found in the code directory provide the capability to getting started in producing an object detection model using the DOTA dataset.
